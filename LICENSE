   1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for 
      NonCommercial purposes only; and

   Media and formats; technical modifications. The Licensor authorizes You to 
   exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or

   forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the 
   Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent 
   Effective Technological Measures.

      of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence 
or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of 
warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

6. TERM AND TERMINATION
